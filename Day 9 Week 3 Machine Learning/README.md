# Machine Learning Basics with Scikit-learn Workshop
Repository for the 2023 Fall City Colleges of Chicago Machine Learning University Bootcamp

The workshop is divided into 4 parts. Day 1 is about the introduction of the scikit-learn library. Day 2 focuses on supervised learning models. Day 3 explores non-supervised learning models. Day 4 is about data cleaning and transformation and 2nd half focuses on model selection and evaluation.  

## How to Run the Notebooks on your Local Machine

You can run the workshop on your local maching by creating a specific Anaconda environment with this line of code:

`conda create -n python_ml_env pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyterlab`

To activate the environment, you can use

`conda activate python_ml_env`

After this, you can download the entire repository with the "download code" green button on the right-upper corner of the [repository homepage](https://github.com/Milan-Chicago/Introduction-to-Python). Finally, you can use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab (both included with Anaconda) to open the local versions of the notebooks.

The very last part of the workshop cannot be run on Colab, so it may be convenient to run the entire workshop locally. 

## Solutions to Exercises

You can find the solutions to the exercises in the following links:

1.   [Solution Exercises Part 1](Day_1_Answers.ipynb)
2.   [Solution Exercises Part 2](Day_2_Answers.ipynb)
3.   [Solution Exercises Part 3](Day_3_Answers.ipynb)
4.   [Solution Exercises Part 4](Day_4_Answers.ipynb)
5.   [Solution Exercises Part 5](Day_5_Answers.ipynb)

To see how the solutions work, you will have to copy paste the code in the original notebooks: the code will not work in the solutions' notebook.
