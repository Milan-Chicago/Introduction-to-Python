    "This week is going to focus on the Python package Pandas. However, Pandas (and many other Python packages) are built on NumPy arrays. NumPy is another Python module, and NumPy arrays are multi-dimensional datasets made up entirely of numerical data. They allow for much faster calculations than other basic Python objects. If you work with large numerical datasets, you will also want to look into the NumPy package. NumPy arrays do not have the features that many of us want to work with, such as column headers and the ability to work with non-numerical data; that's why pandas is so popular."

    "To return a DataFrame that only has rows that meet a certain condition, we use this syntax. The outer `df[]` lets Python know that you want the answer to be returned as a DataFrame, meaning you can return all the columns included in the output. Inside the indexing, we include our boolean statement, which usually means we need to index a particular column in the dataset to filter the data on."
