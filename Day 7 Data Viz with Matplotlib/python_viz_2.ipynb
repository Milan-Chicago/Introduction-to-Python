The latter option spares us the need to recalculate the limits since `matplotlib` will take care of rescaling those as well -- with the caveat that we need to make sure we do not pass a negative value to a `log` transformation!

    "Now, you may have noticed that this `Rectangle`s do not belong to any `Axes` or `Figure`: we just created an abstract rectangle and specified its coordinates, color and label. At this point, we need to make sure that the `Axes` actually plots these `Rectangle`s. To do this, we can pass the two `Rectangle`s to the method `ax.add_patch()`. We will add them one at the time (so we will call the method twice). \n",
