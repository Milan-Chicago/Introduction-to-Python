    "In the code above, I prepare the data for `ax.hist()`. create four `np.array` containing the birth year of each boy named \"Morgan\" born in the US between 1965 and 2014; the birty year of each girl named \"Morgan\", etc. This `np.array` are nothing but a long list (_not_ in a technical Pythonic sense) of birth years. We did this because the method `ax.hist()` takes in input raw data. This is opposed to more convenient tabulated data (as the data was originally arranged in the `DataFrame` we loaded). This is the same difference as having a list containing 1965 three times (`[1965, 1965, 1965]`) versus having a dictionary telling us that there are 3 individual named \"Morgan\" born in 1965 (`{1965:3}`).\n",

You can pass an integer number k and `ax.hist()` will create k equally speced bins -- by default, `ax.hist()` will create k=10 equally-spaced bins, but this is rarely what we want. Otherwise, you can pass an array showing the boundaries of each bin. We will explore this option later. \n",

    "#### Binning for estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use histograms in a pricipled way to provide a statistical estimation of the data distribution, you will need to implement one of the many binning strategies presented in the literature. Fortunately, `np` provides some ready-available implementation of the most popular statistical binning strategy. In particular, the function `np.histogram_bin_edges()` will calculate the binning following the popular Freedman-Diaconis and Sturgis (R default) binning strategies. We can use the output of this function directly in the `bins` argument of `ax.hist()`. Even if you do not want to adventure in the literature, the Freedman-Diaconis rule is usually a good choice and most likely superior than simply using an arbitrary number of equally-spaced bins (as we have done so far).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use the Freedman-Diaconis rule to compare the \"Morgan\" data, boys and girls. A little care must be put on the input to the Freedman-Diaconis binning rule. The binning will depend on the data size and will become progressively finer as the size increases. Yet, notice that we have ~10 times more girls than boys named \"Morgan\". So the binning we would get for the boy data would be much coarser than the binning we would get for the girl data. A quick rule of thumb for these cases: when you compare datasets having different data sizes you will want to use the coarser binning to err on the side of robustness. So, we will input the boy data (`morgan_boys`) to the `np.histogram_bin_edges()` function.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "    <b>Binning</b>: The choice of the right binning is fundamental to construct a good histogram. Indeed, you can see the histogram as an estimator. Too many bins means that you put too much confidence in your data. Too few bins means that you are not using your data optimally. And your confidence should change depending on the region of the space -- some region will be more populated than others in your data. <a href=\"https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/histogram.html\">This tutorial</a> from AstroPy shows how different binning strategies can tell completely different stories based on the same data. Researchers have investigated binning strategy for decades. The function histogram_bin_edges() implements some of the most popular binning strategies available from literature. These strategy are completely automatic (you do not need to specify the number of bins) and provide a strong theoretical justification for your bins. See <a href=\"https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/histogram.html\">the official numpy documentation</a> for an overview of what is available.\n",

    "Finally, we may want to stack (not overlap) the two histograms. In this way, we will show the overall trend for the data, but we will still show the relative importance of the different components. In this case, we will show the overall contribution of boys and girls to the overall popularity of the name \"Morgan\".\n",

Here, we will see the simplest way to produce stacked histograms: when you pass a list of data series (as we did in the plot above), it is sufficient to specify the argument `stacked=True`. For more control, you should check the argument `bottom` from the `ax.hist()` [official documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist).

    "1. Code in a live fashion in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Personally, I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), but there are many valid options available.\n",
    "2. **Make your plot reproducible**. Following the spirit of open science and open data you should also share the code you used to create the plot you eventually published. As it should be clear by now, plotting may require some complex coding. At the same time, plots are powerful narrative devices: by changing your plots, you can tell different stories about the same data. Therefore, you should make your plotting (narrative) choices as explicit as possible by sharing your plotting code.\n",
    "3. However, you may not want to water down your main analysis script with over-complicated and long plotting code. I would suggest you share your plotting code in separate files or you create plotter functions to be imported. \n",
