Spain,"There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over.

Spain,"Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years. Flavors of toasted bread and apple are long on complexity and short on fruit, but once again that's what distinguishes Gramona from the masses.",III Lustros Gran Reserva,91,45.0,Catalonia,Cava,Gramona 2005 III Lustros Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),Sparkling Blend,Gramona
Spain,"Beefy stuff for a young wine with only four months of oak aging. Still, there's bacon and generous black-fruit aromas followed by black cherry, plum, tobacco and pepper flavors.

Spain,"One of the biggest wines you'll find from Spain. It starts with brawny, malty aromas of ultraripe berries, leather and earthy warmth. The palate is searing, with baked pie flavors, chocolate and heat. Finishes with even more licorice and mint, and at 16% this is one chewy red wine. Not for fans of elegant, lighter-framed reds.

Spain,"Spice, tobacco and berry fruit work the nose on this firm, medium-bodied Ribera wine. A mouthfeel that's fresh and snappy might be seen as short and choppy by anyone seeking more extract and body, but overall the wine pushes forward with purpose and intent.

Spain,"A clear step up from the overdone 2003 Propiedad, this vintage is sweet and easy to like. There's a blast of hickory smoke on the new-oak nose, but also black fruit and molasses. The ripe palate deals chewy fruit, medium tannins and moderate length. It's a charming but blunt wine, and all in all it's probably not one to hold for too long.

Spain,"Although this blend is perfectly good, it does have an herbal, green, minty streak that's likely due to the 30% Syrah and Cabernet bolstering 70% Garnacha.

Spain,"Unlike the regular Clavidor, this old-vines wine glistens and slides across the nose and palate with nary a whiff of wood.

Spain,"Takes time to unfold after an early blast of saucy spice, hoisin, chili powder and black fruit. The palate is forward and charged, with deep raspberry, cherry and sizzle.

Spain,"Fulget is yet another rock-solid Albariño from 2007, a cool year that favored balanced whites throughout Spain. Flower blossoms, apple and mineral aromas set it off. The flavor profile mostly settles on orange, and if there's a weakness it's that there isn't much variety or layering of flavors. Finishes with gusto.

A pure, tangy finish holds firm.",Ethereo,90,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,Bodegas Eidosela 2015 Ethereo Albariño (Rías Baixas),Albariño,Bodegas Eidosela
Spain,"Cool, minty aromas of blueberry and blackberry set up a full, tannic palate, which is what you'd expect from a young Ribera del Duero. Grabby, tannic fullness offers flavors of meaty black fruits, herbs and tobacco. A savory finish runs long on a frame of blocky tannins.",,90,45.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula 2014  Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
Spain,"This Verdejo smells like citrus fruits and wild field grass, with a hint of feline aroma. Crisp and fresh, it offers flavors of melon, nectarine and nettle. A long, slightly salty finish is braced by bright acidity. Drink right away, if possible.",,90,19.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,Martinsancho 2015 Verdejo (Rueda),Verdejo,Martinsancho
Spain,"After 23 months in barrel, this Viura-Malvasia blend shows a yellow color and dry resiny oak-based aromas along with apple in the backdrop. Round and slightly oily in texture, this tastes of salted nuts and baked apple on a woody base. Oaky salty flavors persist on the finish.",Gran Reserva,91,43.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Valserrano 2009 Gran Reserva White (Rioja),White Blend,Valserrano
Spain,"Dry apple and lemon aromas are clean and one step above neutral. In the mouth, this barrel-fermented Verdejo feels full and flush, with citrusy acidity. Integrated oak notes accent a core orange flavor on the finish of this finely made Spanish white.",Finca Las Marcas Fermentado en Barrica,91,40.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,Carlos Moro 2015 Finca Las Marcas Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),Verdejo,Carlos Moro
Spain,"This represents Torres' highest effort in Priorat, and it's a success. Perpetual deals freshly laid asphalt, cola and grilled char on the nose and then follows that up with black cherry, cassis and tobacco flavors. It's pure and ripe more than intellectual. Best 2009–2013; 60 cases produced.",Salmos Perpetual,91,52.0,Catalonia,Priorat,Torres 2005 Salmos Perpetual Red (Priorat),Red Blend,Torres
Spain,"Arguably on the heavy and rich side, but if you like chocolate, spice and pretty good pop across the palate, this is recommended. Rugged but not out of whack, with meaty dark-fruit flavors and bitter espresso/pepper on the finish. Should come together nicely over the next two years.",Crianza,91,26.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Costaval 2005 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),Tempranillo Blend,Costaval
Spain,"Lightly baked berry aromas vie for attention with leather, spice and mild earth notes, and the result is disjointed. On the palate, this is tight as a drum initially, but more expansive as it unfolds. Cherry, plum, raspberry, vanilla and woodspice flavors finish pure, clean and easy. This is a fine yet manageable Rioja that's not trying too hard. Drink through 2016.",Crianza,90,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Viñedos Real Rubio 2010 Crianza  (Rioja),Tempranillo Blend,Viñedos Real Rubio
