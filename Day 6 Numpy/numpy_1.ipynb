    "## Introduction to NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumPy** is the primary scientific computing library in Python that adds support for fast and efficient handling of large multi-dimensional arrays (matrices). It resembles MATLAB both in its functionality and design, making it a popular open-source alternative to the proprietary numerical computing software. However, there are some key differences between NumPy and MATLAB that this tutorial will attempt to outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary building block of NumPy is the `numpy.ndarray`, also known by and commonly referred to using the alias `numpy.array` or `np.array`. It is a homogeneous multi-dimensional (*n-dimensional*) array that is fixed in size. (Note that this is somewhat different from MATLAB that defaults to 2D matrices.) The numpy `np.array` differs from a regular Python `list` in three key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All elements in a `np.array` must be the same datatype. (For example, only integers or only floating-point numbers, but never both.)\n",
    "2. The datatype of an `np.array` or its elements cannot be changed in-place. To do so, a new array must be created and elements have to be copied over and re-cast into a different datatype.\n",
    "2. The size of a `np.array` is fixed - new elements cannot be added nor can elements be removed. However, elements can be overwritten as long as you keep the same datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that Python also contains a type of array called `array.array` which supports only one dimension and hence is very different from the NumPy `np.array`.*"

As all NumPy elements are actually objects of the library itself, one needs to type out the name of the library all the time when using it. (This applies to most libraries in Python.) Hence, it is common to import numpy under the alias `np` to avoid having to type out the full `numpy` over and over again."

This is computationally more efficient and allows NumPy to preform fast operations even on really large and complex arrays because the data is never copied over in computer memory. Instead we are shown the same array stored in memory using a slightly different view (you can think of it as a window) that perhaps blocks out some elements and changes the order of others. **Most** operations in NumPy, including **all** indexing and slicing operations, result in a different ***view*** of the original array, never a copy.\n",

In MATLAB, most operations result in a ***copy*** of the original array, allowing you to modify the outputs of various operations without having to worry about changing the original data. Hence, avid MATLAB users must keep in mind that this is not the case in NumPy to avoid unintentionally overwriting data.\n",
